Chapter 25: The Iskandari Revolt and the Struggle for Indian Ocean Sovereignty (1750–1850)


Introduction: A Forgotten Global Struggle
Historians often emphasize the rise of industrial capitalism and European imperial dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries, portraying these forces as nearly inevitable in shaping the modern world. Yet, the actual reality was far more complex and nuanced. Local actors across the globe fiercely resisted European economic control, challenging assumptions of European supremacy.
Among the most significant, though often overlooked, movements of this period was the Iskandari Revolt (1768–1850), a merchant-led uprising that disrupted European trade networks across the Indian Ocean. Named after the enigmatic leader Iskandar al-Rashid, the revolt spanned nearly a century and engaged Arab, Persian, Indian, and East African communities in a struggle against the monopolistic practices of European powers. The movement not only reshaped the commercial landscape of the Indian Ocean but also delayed European dominance in the region and influenced future anti-colonial struggles.


1. The Indian Ocean Trade System Before European Domination
The Lifeline of Global Commerce
For centuries, the Indian Ocean had been one of the most vibrant and interconnected trade networks in world history. Merchants from the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa engaged in a sophisticated exchange of goods such as spices, textiles, gold, and ivory. Unlike the Atlantic system, which was increasingly dominated by European empires, the Indian Ocean operated on a relatively decentralized model, where local rulers and merchant guilds maintained a delicate balance of power.
The region was characterized by cooperative economic relationships between traders of various religious and ethnic backgrounds. Arab dhows, Indian chettis, and Swahili merchants transported goods across vast distances, facilitating a system sustained by centuries of trust and mutual benefit. Trade was also facilitated by the predictable monsoon winds, which allowed for seasonal navigation that connected disparate economies into an integrated commercial web.

European Encroachments and the Struggle for Control
By the 17th century, European powers—especially Portugal, the Netherlands, and Britain—had set their sights on controlling the lucrative spice and textile trade in the Indian Ocean. The Portuguese had already established a foothold in Goa and East Africa, the Dutch controlled the spice trade in Indonesia, and the British East India Company (EIC) expanded its influence in India.
These European companies imposed restrictive trade policies, leveraging their naval superiority to enforce monopolies that excluded local traders. Indigenous merchants, once the dominant force in the region, found themselves marginalized. The EIC imposed punitive taxes on local traders, while the Dutch VOC restricted direct trade between indigenous groups, forcing them to go through European intermediaries at higher costs. Over time, frustration built among indigenous merchants, and resentment against these policies eventually led to the first signs of organized resistance.


2. Iskandar al-Rashid: The Merchant Revolutionary
From Trader to Rebel Leader
Iskandar al-Rashid, born in 1734 in Muscat, Oman, into a prominent merchant family, initially worked as a trader dealing in textiles and spices. He frequently traveled between the Persian Gulf, India, and East Africa. Over time, he became increasingly frustrated with the European trade restrictions, particularly the British and Dutch monopolies that severely limited opportunities for indigenous traders.
As a young merchant, Iskandar witnessed firsthand how local traders were being squeezed out of the market. European companies manipulated prices, imposed exorbitant duties, and engaged in brutal military actions against those who defied their rules. In 1765, after losing a major shipment to the British East India Company's predatory taxation, he began organizing clandestine meetings with fellow merchants, arguing that European dominance could only be countered through coordinated resistance.

The Formation of the Iskandari Coalition
In 1768, Iskandar al-Rashid officially declared the formation of the Iskandari Coalition, a loose alliance of merchants, privateers, and anti-colonial factions. The movement was not merely anti-European; it sought to restore indigenous control over trade networks and revive a more equitable system of commerce.
The coalition gained support from a broad range of groups, including Arab traders from Oman, Indian merchants from Gujarat, Swahili city-states from East Africa, and even disaffected members of the Mughal and Ottoman military. These diverse forces united under a shared goal: the dismantling of European monopolies and the restoration of a fair trade system in the Indian Ocean.


3. The Revolt Expands: A Colonial War Engulfs the Indian Ocean (1768–1850)
Raiding the European Monopolies
Unlike traditional military uprisings, the Iskandari Revolt relied heavily on economic sabotage and guerrilla-style naval warfare. Using a fleet of fast, maneuverable dhows—small, agile ships that could easily navigate the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean—the rebels launched targeted raids on European trading posts, disrupting supply chains, attacking vulnerable ports, and redistributing wealth back into the hands of local economies. These raids were often combined with psychological warfare, exploiting European naval overconfidence and utilizing the rebels' superior local knowledge.

The Siege of Muscat (1771)
The first major engagement in the Iskandari Revolt occurred in 1771 when Iskandar al-Rashid's forces laid siege to Muscat, a strategically important British stronghold in the Arabian Peninsula. Muscat, a vital port for British interests, was key to controlling trade routes in the Gulf and beyond. The Iskandari forces, armed with locally manufactured cannons and utilizing a network of informants, managed to sever British supply lines and surrounded the city. Over a grueling four-month siege, the rebels used hit-and-run tactics, cutting off British reinforcements and sabotaging British munitions stores. The British garrison, unfamiliar with desert warfare, suffered from diseases and low morale. Faced with mounting losses, the British were forced to evacuate. Iskandar al-Rashid declared Muscat an autonomous trade hub, reasserting local control over a key part of the Indian Ocean trade network and setting the stage for further resistance across the region.
The War Reaches Its Peak (1810–1830)
By the early 19th century, the Iskandari Revolt had escalated into a full-scale, global conflict, with battles stretching far beyond the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic theater and even the Americas. The unity among anti-colonial factions, from the Indian subcontinent to East Africa, and their collaboration with other global powers like Qing China, led to significant victories that weakened European influence in both the East and the West. Some of the most decisive and notable battles included:

The Battle of Goa (1812): One of the most significant naval confrontations of the revolt, the Battle of Goa saw Iskandari forces facing off against the Portuguese fleet, which had dominated the spice trade for centuries. With deep knowledge of the monsoon winds, which allowed for seasonal navigation across the Indian Ocean, the Iskandari rebels launched a surprise attack on Portuguese vessels stationed off the coast of Goa. The Iskandari fleet, despite being outnumbered, used their superior tactics and local knowledge to outmaneuver the Portuguese ships. After several days of skirmishes, the Portuguese fleet was forced to retreat, suffering heavy losses. This victory weakened Portuguese dominance in the region and provided an opening for local merchants to resume direct trade without the burden of European middlemen.

The Battle of the Malacca Straits (1821): The Iskandari forces, in an unexpected alliance with the Qing Chinese navy, launched a coordinated assault on British-controlled ports in Southeast Asia. The Malacca Straits, a critical shipping route, were dominated by British interests, and British fortifications there were well-defended. However, the rebels and their Qing allies used knowledge of the region's waterways and monsoon seasons to ambush the British forces. The battle was intense, but the combination of Qing firepower and Iskandari maneuverability on the water proved too much for the British to handle. The British fleet suffered significant losses, and the region's trade routes, once dominated by British control, were disrupted for months.

The Siege of Bombay (1827–1829): This was one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the entire revolt. Iskandari forces, determined to reclaim control over the Indian subcontinent's most important port, laid siege to Bombay for almost two years. With no direct reinforcements coming from Britain due to effective blockades by Iskandari warships, the British garrison suffered heavily from disease, starvation, and internal dissent. The siege was marked by tactical brilliance: Iskandari forces would launch sudden night attacks on British positions and disrupt their fortifications. The pressure on the British forces, combined with international condemnation of their colonial practices, led to their eventual retreat. The siege of Bombay was not just a military victory; it symbolized the collapse of British colonial might in India for a time, and the city was momentarily freed from European control.

Simultaneously, the conflict expanded into the Atlantic theater, where European colonial powers in the Americas were also feeling the pressure from Iskandari-inspired resistance movements. In particular, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and British colonies in the Americas found their interests increasingly threatened by the rise of anti-colonial sentiment that had begun in the Indian Ocean.
The Battle of Cartagena (1791): In the Caribbean, the Spanish port of Cartagena was under threat from the British, who had been expanding their hold over Latin American territories. The Spanish, however, rallied local militias and privateers sympathetic to the broader anti-colonial cause, including some with direct ties to Iskandari networks. The resulting naval engagement was marked by fierce fighting, with the Spanish fleet, reinforced by local forces, repelling a British attack. The victory at Cartagena disrupted British plans to expand in South America and boosted the morale of independence movements in Spanish-controlled territories.

The Battle of Havana (1808): In Cuba, British forces attempted to take the Spanish-controlled port of Havana, a crucial link in the Spanish colonial trade network. However, the Spanish defense, bolstered by Iskandari-aligned privateers and local militias, managed to stave off the British. The successful defense of Havana dealt a significant blow to British efforts in the Caribbean and undermined their ability to enforce maritime dominance in the Americas.

The Second Battle of New Orleans (1815): Although it took place during the War of 1812, the Second Battle of New Orleans also involved local resistance movements with deep ties to the broader anti-colonial struggle. The Americans, supported by privateers and anti-colonial factions sympathetic to Iskandari ideals, managed to defeat a British force that had been attempting to capture the city. This battle not only ensured American control of key ports but also illustrated how the resistance movements in the Americas were increasingly interconnected with global anti-colonial movements.

The Battle of Rio de Janeiro (1820): The Battle of Rio de Janeiro was a pivotal naval conflict during Brazil's war for independence from Portugal. Brazilian forces, aided by Iskandari-aligned privateers, successfully defended the port city from Portuguese assault. This victory was a major blow to Portugal's ability to control its South American colonies and was instrumental in securing Brazilian independence.

The Rise of the German and Italian Empires
As the Iskandari Revolt raged on, the European political landscape was undergoing significant shifts that would reshape the future of imperialism. The unification of Italy and the unification of Germany in the mid-19th century heralded the rise of two new European powers that would dramatically alter the balance of power in Europe and beyond.

The Unification of Italy (1861): The fragmented states of Italy had long been under the control of foreign powers, including Austria, Spain, and the Papal States. The revolt against European colonial domination inspired nationalist movements across Europe, including Italy. Figures like Giuseppe Garibaldi, who had fought in the Mediterranean against colonial forces, drew inspiration from the Iskandari Revolt and sought to unify Italy as a sovereign nation. This movement for Italian unification was fueled by the same principles of independence, self-determination, and resistance against external rule that had motivated the Iskandari rebellion.

The Unification of Germany (1871): Similarly, the unification of Germany in the latter part of the 19th century was spurred by nationalism and military consolidation. Leaders like Otto von Bismarck, who sought to unite the German-speaking states under a single empire, were influenced by the growing sense of European nationalism that had been brewing for decades. The Iskandari Revolt’s success in challenging colonial empires had an indirect but notable impact on European political thought, contributing to the rise of nationalistic movements in both Germany and Italy. The unified German Empire would later become a colonial power in its own right, further shifting the global balance of power.


4. Resolution and Lasting Impact
By 1850, European powers, exhausted by the prolonged conflict and facing mounting resistance across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, were compelled to seek diplomatic resolutions. The Treaty of Zanzibar (1850), which formally ended hostilities, granted greater autonomy to Indian Ocean trade networks and restructured colonial trade agreements to favor indigenous merchants.

Technological and Political Consequences
The prolonged conflict led to significant innovations in naval warfare. Iskandari forces, through necessity, developed hybrid ship designs that blended European firepower with indigenous maneuverability. These ships, faster and more adaptable than their European counterparts, revolutionized naval tactics in the Indian Ocean and beyond.
As European empires were weakened, they adopted new governance strategies, relying more on local rulers to maintain control—a model that would persist well into the 20th century.

Inspiration for Later Independence Movements
The Iskandari Revolt not only disrupted European colonial rule in the Indian Ocean but also served as a precursor to later anti-colonial struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It showed that European dominance could be contested, inspiring future movements that would eventually dismantle colonial empires across the globe.


5. Conclusion: A War That Changed the Course of History
The Iskandari Revolt was not just a regional uprising—it was a global confrontation that reshaped the course of imperialism, trade, and governance. Although largely forgotten in mainstream historical narratives, its impact resonates deeply in the modern era. The revolt exposed the vulnerabilities of the European colonial system, showing that European dominance could be contested and, in some cases, successfully resisted.
In many ways, the Iskandari Revolt foreshadowed the larger anti-colonial movements that would gain momentum in the 20th century. It challenged the notion that European empires were invincible and demonstrated the power of local and indigenous resistance. Moreover, the legacy of Iskandar al-Rashid and the Iskandari Coalition remains a testament to the resilience and determination of those who fought to reclaim their autonomy and reshape global trade on more equitable terms.
Ultimately, the revolt was not merely an isolated event but a pivotal chapter in the broader struggle for sovereignty in the Indian Ocean and beyond. It serves as a reminder that, even in the face of overwhelming odds, resistance movements can have lasting consequences, altering the course of history in ways that often remain underappreciated and overlooked.
